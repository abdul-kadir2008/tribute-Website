        <p>
            <bold>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam </bold>(1931–2015) was an eminent Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who
            served as the
            11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Known as the "Missile Man of India" for his pivotal role in
            developing indigenous missile capabilities (Agni and Prithvi) and space programs (SLV-III), he was a beloved
            leader awarded the Bharat Ratna.
            We are grieved by the loss of former Indian President and Bharat Ratna, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. A selfless
            visionary and mentor, Dr. Kalam has been a role model and a source of inspiration to millions across the
            country. We fondly remember his visit to The Akshaya Patra Foundation in June 2003 where he visited us in
            Bengaluru, helped serve the mid-day meal to beneficiaries, enjoyed a meal with the students and left an
            impression that will last a lifetime.

            During his visit, Dr. Kalam expressed his happiness saying “This is really a very important mission and I
            congratulate Akshaya Patra for the excellent work they have done.” We were touched by his kind words of
            support. Known for his deep love and compassion for children, and steadfast desire to ignite their dreams,
            Dr. Kalam also highlighted how crucial the mid-day meal programme is in providing nutrition and education in
            India.

            It was with his guidance that we launched our Vidya Akshaya Patra Programme, an initiative focused on
            promoting education in government schools across the country. Dr. Kalam was an inspirational leader, a
            dedicated teacher and a true hero. He helped transform the aspirations of our country, and he will be missed
            but never forgotten.

            “Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was one of India’s greatest treasures. Though he is no longer with us, we are left with
            his legacy that will shine bright for years to come,” says Madhu Pandit Dasa, Chairman of Akshaya Patra
